dotfiles
========

Sharing my files here that I use. Most of it is for doing a complete setup for editing and other things
in a nice looking terminal environment. Quick accesses to aliases etc.

I like things being "simple" but advanced at the same time. What I mean by this is the the functionality
should be advanced but the setup simple. Also I have this idea that since I don't know what environment
I will be working in then I should setup things to work in all kinds of environments.

My dofiles changes all the time. So this place will be updated quite frequently to mirror those
changes.
