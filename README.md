dotfiles
========

Sharing my files here that I use. Most of it is for doing a complete setup for editing and other things
in a nice looking terminal environment. Quick accesses to aliases etc.

Terminal
========

Standard prompt:

[user] at [hostname] in [path]
$

Only shown on special occurances for git, svn, mercurial

[user] at [hostname] in [path] (at [branch] [up:number] [uc:number] [pu:number])
$

Example:
somnium at github in GIT/dotfiles/ at master up:1 uc:3 pu:2
$

Where the different items are:
up - updates from remote repo
uc - uncommitted changes from local repo
pu - number of pushes not done from local to remote repo

Install
